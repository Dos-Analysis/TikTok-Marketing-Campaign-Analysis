## Objective
The main question I aimed to answer was: **Who are the top TikTokers to collaborate with in 2024 to maximize campaign effectiveness?**

I created a dashboard that highlights:
- Top 10 TikTokers by subscribers  
- Creators with the most views  
- Creators with the most videos uploaded  
- Engagement metrics such as views per subscriber and subscriber engagement rate

## Data Source
The dataset comes from **Kaggle** (Excel extract) and contains information on the top TikTokers in France in 2024, including:
- Channel names  
- Total subscribers  
- Total views  
- Total videos uploaded

- **SQL Server** â†’ Data cleaning, testing, and transformations  
- **Power BI** â†’ Interactive dashboards and data visualization  
- **GitHub** â†’ Documentation and portfolio hosting

## Process
I followed a structured workflow to deliver the final analysis:

1. **Data Exploration**  
   - Scanned the dataset for errors, inconsistencies, and unnecessary fields.  
   - Extracted TikTok channel names and standardized columns.  

2. **Data Cleaning & Transformation**  
   - Removed irrelevant columns.  
   - Ensured consistent data types.  
   - Built SQL views for a clean, analysis-ready dataset.  

3. **Testing & Validation**

   - Checked for duplicates and data type integrity.  

4. **Visualization in Power BI**  
   - Designed a dashboard answering key marketing questions.  
   - Built DAX measures for subscriber counts, total views, engagement rates, and ROI scenarios.
